# Docs Template  
A Skeleton based theme and HTML template for code documentation.

The __Docs Template__ is built with [Skeleton responsive CSS framework](http://www.getskeleton.con) and runs on purely HTML, CSS and JavaScript so you can use it with a modern web browser on your local machine of any platform. No internet, command line, building, or compiling needed.

---

## Features  

- All documentation can be on one page or multiple pages (requires more coding)
- Includes one theme so you're ready to go out of the box; new themes are simply new CSS files
- Themes are built on Skeleton Responsive CSS Framework so multiple platforms are supported
- No additional compiling or building means you can package it directly with your project
- Gets you set up quick!

## Documentation

## Demo

A demo of the theme with more extensive documentation can be found in use at the [Rotator.js](http://web.cmfolio.com/projects/rotator/) project.
