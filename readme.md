# Docs Template  
A basic HTML/CSS template for code documentation.

The __Docs Template__ runs on purely HTML, CSS and JavaScript so you can use it on your local machine on any platform with a modern web browser. No internet, command line, building, or compiling needed.

---

## Features  

- All documentation can be on one page or multiple pages (requires more coding)
- Includes one theme so you're ready to go out of the box; new themes are simply new CSS files
- Gets you set up quick!

## Documentation

Documentation for Docs is the process of being built. If you would like to preview them, check out the `/docs/` folder in the repo.
