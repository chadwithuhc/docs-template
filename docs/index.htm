		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>Learn what <strong>Docs</strong> is all about and how you can use it.</p>
		<p></p>
		
		<h2>What does it do?</h2>
		<p><strong>Docs</strong> is a simple HTML and CSS template for documentation of a project. It is made to provide documentation for smaller projects that don't need a whole user guide. An ideal use of <strong>Docs</strong> would be for a project with 5-6 basic <em>sections</em> that need to be covered. There is no limit to how many pages you can create. However, anything excessive would make better use of a full feature documentation tool.</p>

		<h2>What are some good uses for Docs?</h2>
		<p><strong>Docs</strong> is perfect for your JavaScript plugin, basic framework, module, or small API. </p>
	
		<h2>How hard is it to implement?</h2>
		<p>There's only a few main steps to take to get your rotator up and running.</p>
		<p><strong>Copy and rename the <code>_template</code> folder in your project: </strong></p>
		<ol class="numbers">
			<li>Copy the <code>_template</code> folder from the root of the repo</li>
			<li>Paste it into your project and rename it to <code>docs</code> or whatever you'd like</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><strong>Replace the following variables in the <code>index.html</code> file: </strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><var>_Project_</var> &mdash; becomes your project name; (E.g. <strong>Docs</strong> or <strong>Docs API</strong>)</li>
			<li><var>_Project Description Short_</var> &mdash; becomes your project short description (one sentence); (E.g. <em>A basic HTML/CSS template for code documentation.</em>; used in page title)</li>
			<li><var>_Project Description_</var> &mdash; becomes your project description; (E.g. <em>A basic HTML/CSS template built to help you quickly set up documentation for your project</em>)</li>
			<li><var>_Company_</var> &mdash; becomes the company or person who holds the license for this project; (E.g. <em>cmfolio</em>)</li>
			<li><var>_Company URL_</var> &mdash; becomes your company or personal url; (E.g. <em>http://web.cmfolio.com</em>)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How can I customize <strong>Docs</strong>?</h2>
		<p>Since you already have full control over the HTML you generate, we provide some basic themes for you to start with. You can either take out themes and modify them or create a new one from scratch.</p>

		<h2>What are the requirements?</h2>
		<p><strong>Docs</strong> is purely HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You do not need any specific backend language or database to run <strong>Docs</strong>. This is done to ensure it can run on a machine locally so you can include documentation with your project regardless of what platform it is on.</p>

		<h2>Some Examples</h2>
		<p>This documentation is powered by <strong>Docs</strong> so there really isn't much more to show. You can see our different <a href="#themes">Themes</a> or take the time to view the source of these docs or the <code>_template</code> folder if you'd like.</p>
	</div>
	
	<!-- THEMES -->
	<div id="themes" class="section">
		<h1>Themes</h1>
		<p>Design <strong>Docs</strong> to fit your project</p>

		<h2 id="available_themes">Available Themes</h2>
		<p>We currently include two themes with <strong>Docs</strong>: <a href="#available_themes" onclick="setActiveStyleSheet('default')">default</a> and <a href="#available_themes" onclick="setActiveStyleSheet('basic')">basic</a>. Click on the links to preview them on this documentation.</p>
		
		<h2>Creating Themes</h2>
		<p>We plan to provide a documentation outline for best practices when coding your docs and when styling your docs. At the moment, we only have our current docs. So duplicate that and modify for now.</p>
		
		<h2>Contributing Themes</h2>
		<p>If you have created a theme that you would like to contribute to <strong>Docs</strong>, please <a href="https://github.com/chadwithuhc/docs-template" target="_blank">fork the project</a> on github and submit a pull request for us to add it in. We thank you for any contributions!</p>

	<!-- SUPPORT -->
	<div id="support" class="section">
		<h1>Support</h1>
		<p>eh. not so much.</p>

		<h2>Sorry</h2>
		<p>Unfortunately, we do not offer any support at the moment. <strong>Docs</strong> is made as a base template, so turn it into what you want!</p>
